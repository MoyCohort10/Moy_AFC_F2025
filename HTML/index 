When working with node:

1. Create a parent directory
2. You will ned an index.js name
3. Run a command => npm init or npm init -y
4. Install your modules. (aka dependecies)
 Hey- i will need you at some point
 5. USE the modules (import, references, or just use the box)
  I need you and i am making you avaiable in my app
6. run the app => npm run dev
